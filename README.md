# GAMAN-Project-for-TruEra-Challenge-Build-LLM-Applications-with-Google-Cloud-Vertex-AI-2023
A Marketplace for Open Science Projects!  

When I decided to join TruEra Challenge: Build LLM Applications with Google Cloud Vertex AI Hackathon, first thing that came up to my mind was that I aim to expand Large Language Model (LLM) with Google Vertex AI & TruLens for my project which is NASA: A MARKETPLACE FOR OPEN SCIENCE PROJECTS!

This project was inspired by our experiences in NASA Hackathon Space Apps Challenges 2023. We want to upgrade this project with Vertex AI & TruLens. Also, we aim to expand NASA Open Science project database into LLM. We want to create a marketplace for project creators (such as: enterprises, universities, government agencies, etc) to find contributors (such as: researchers, scientists, students, professionals, etc) who match with all skills & expertise required in the project.

Thus, I want to use NASA Marketplace as my case for this TruEra Challenge Hackathon. I eager to investigate how TruLens will be able to evaluate my LLM with regard to the RAG Triad ( Answer Relevance, Context relevance, and Groundedness).

So, the objective is that we want to create a marketplace for open science projects so that open science projects will be more accessible for everyone (contributors) who eager to contribute to science projects related to their interests. Also, we want to build a marketplace for project creators to find contributors who match with all skills & expertise required in the project. In this web app, we create open science project marketplace which has some features as follows: 

(1) NASA SEARCH ENGINE - AI CHATTING BOT 

(2) NASA SUGGESTION SYSTEM / RECOMMENDATION SYSTEM 

(3) NASA COMMUNICATION TOOLS. 

(4) TRULENS STREAMLIT FOR EVALUATING LLM

With all those features, we are hoping that all interactions between project creators and project contributors in any NASA Open Science Project will become more accessible, interactive, and fun. In addition, this web app will make NASA Open Data become easier to find and more organized.

You can try the demo in my Streamlit app: https://nasaproject2023-dzgwiak2nirgiw4ibixxjc.streamlit.app/

For AI Chatting Bot, here is the link of demo: https://clipchamp.com/watch/gghjhWERJ2I

For communication tool between project creators and contributors, we will do video & chat in platform https://brie.fi/ng/ficky01#ficky01

For checking the TRULENS STREAMLIT, here is the link of google colab for this project: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/11W9watN1WbID39pZT46nfECNpmQOJp1_?usp=sharing

Pain Point

Currently, there is no place online for Open Science project creators and skilled participants (contributors) to find each other, mingle, and foster professional relationships to work on interesting open research projects. The idea behind this project is to provide a valuable solution that open science contributors in looking for interesting and relevant project ideas based on their interest and expertises.

Objectives

The main objectives of this web app is to create a marketplace for open science projects so that open science projects will be more accessible for everyone who eager to contribute to science projects related to their interests. Also, we want to build a marketplace for project creators to find creators who match with all skills & expertise required in the project. We will be building this marketplace in web application using Machine Learning, Large Language Model (LLM), Generative AI and Natural Language Processing (NLP).
